# WEATHER QUERY PLATFORM
This is a weather platform that is solely for getting information on the weather conditions of any location you so desire to know about. The information displayed after quering the platform is up-to-date and can be used to make decisions. 

This platform utilizes and consumes information that has been made available and accessible by: https://openweathermap.org/api/

## BUILT WITH
This application was built with the following technologies:

<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>


### GETTING STARTED
If you need to clone this repo then these are the steps to take:

Open a terminal / command line interface on your computer and navigate to your desired directory.

Clone the repo by using the following:

  git clone:
  
     https://github.com/LincKim/Weather-Query-Platform.git
  
  or using the SSh Key:

  git clone:
  
    git@github.com:LincKim/Weather-Query-Platform.git 


### PREREQUISITES
The app will be live and the link is provided further down the short read.

Otherwise if you need it at you local machine then the steps provided above will kickstart the process.

After you have cloned the repo into your local machine then in your terminal navigate into the repository and if you have VS Code then open using the following command:

    code .

In this case you won't need to run the 'db json server' because the data is being fetched from a remote location.
 

#### Running the tests
The Web App will be live and this means that you should be able to query on the weather conditions of the place you are interested in.

This Project seeks to test my understanding on:

<li>Manipulating the DOM</li>
<li>Recognizing JS Events</li>
<li>Communicating with the server</li>

## Deployment
This Webpage is hosted on netlify.
The Web App is live via this link: https://linc-weather.netlify.app/
